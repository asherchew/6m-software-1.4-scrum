## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Scrum is a structured yet flexible framework that promotes efficiency, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Here are some key ways Scrum can improve IT team productivity:

1. Enhanced Focus and Prioritization:
- Sprint Planning: Breaking down work to be performed into sprints using previous measures of a team's velocity, which are time-boxed periods (usually 2-4 weeks). This helps the team focus on a set of prioritized tasks without getting distracted by other issues.

- Product Backlog Refinement: Continuous prioritization of the product backlog ensures that the team is always working on the most important and valuable tasks.

2. Improved Collaboration and Communication:
- Daily Scrum: These brief daily meetings help team members synchronize their work, discuss progress, and quickly address any impediments.

- Cross-functional Teams: Members with different skill sets work together, enhancing teamwork and reducing handoff delays.

3. Increased Transparency and Accountability:
- Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives: At the end of each sprint, the team reviews what was accomplished and discusses what went well and what could be improved.

- Visible Progress: Scrum artifacts like the sprint backlog make the team's progress visible to all stakeholders, enhancing transparency.
```

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1. As a new user, I want to register for an account, so that I can borrow books from the library.

2. As a registered user, I want to log in to my account, so that I can access my borrowing history and request new books.

3. As a user, I want to search for books by title, author, or genre, so that I can find books I am interested in borrowing.

4. As a user, I want to view details of a book, such as the summary, author, publication date, and availability, so that I can decide if I want to borrow it.

5. As a logged-in user, I want to request to borrow a book, so that I can read it.

6. As a user, I want to reserve a book that is currently unavailable, so that I can borrow it when it becomes available.

7. As a user, I want to renew a borrowed book, so that I can extend the borrowing period if I need more time to read it.

8. As a user, I want to receive notifications about due dates, overdue books, and availability of reserved books, so that I can manage my borrowings effectively.

9. As a user, I want to leave reviews and rate the books I have read so that I can share my opinions with other users and help them decide what to read.

10. As a library admin, I want to add, update, or remove books in the library inventory so that the catalog is always up-to-date for users.
